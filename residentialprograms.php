                <h1> Residential Loan Programs</h1>
		<p class="specialh2"> There are many loan programs to fit almost any need. Please call us today and ask which loan program best fits your situation.</p>
<br />

		<h3>15-Year and 30-Year Fixed Rate</h3>
		<p>Payment and rate stay the same from start to finish, plus tax.</p>

		<h3>5 and 7 Year Balloons</h3>
		<p>Lower start rate. Some of the balloon programs may be converted to an adjustable rate or a fixed rate after the 5 or 7 years, with very low fees and attractive rates.</p>

		<h3>Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM)</h3>
		<p>Lowest start rate. Adjusts either every 6 months or every 12 months depending on program and grade and is based on the economy 6% ceiling for prime and 7% ceiling for sub-prime.</p>

		<h3>5/1 and 7/1 Fixed Rate</h3>
		<p>Rate is fixed for the first 5 or 7 years, then shifts to an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM).</p>

		<h3>2/28 and 3/27 ARM</h3>
		<p>An ARM program that is fixed for the first 2 or 3 years, then shifts into a 6 month adjustable rate mortgage. It is a sub-prime program giving you a rate lower than the sub-prime 30-year fixed, and if you have had credit problems, it allows a window of time for credit rebuilding and seasoning. You will then want to refinance this loan.</p>
