In addition, as a principle in various companies, he has provided conventional residential and commercial mortgage brokerage services through various companies. As the demand for non-traditional commercial real estate financing grew, John founded Landmark Realty Capital, a private investment fund.  At Equiventure Capital, John is responsible for nationwide marketing and consulting services to companies and clients involved in a wide-range of real estate projects.  John holds a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting from Iona College, a CPA (1991) and Real Estate licenses from the State of New York. </p>
