                <h1> Joint Venture Financing</h1>
		<p class="specialh2"> 
		Joint venture financing is similar to a partnership in that it must be created by agreement between the parties to share in the losses and profits of the venture.  Even though our Clients may not start out looking for partners, they recognize the value of sharing equity over "straight" debt financing. As a result, through joint venture financing, our Clients can reduce the amount of their personal capital at risk but still focus on the goal to achieve project funding.  Also, for Clients lacking the experience necessary to fulfill the debt lender's requirements, specific potential joint venture partners have the track record to satisfy this.  Depending on the Client's financial strength and/or experience, joint venture financing may be the only financing strategy to assure their project funded.
