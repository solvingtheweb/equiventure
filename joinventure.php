                <h1> Joint Venture Financing</h1>
		<p class="specialh2"> 
		Equiventure Capital has access to many sources and providers of joint venture financing.  This is achieved by creating a team between the Client and the Lender/Investor with the added financial capacity.		
		</p>
		<p class="specialh2"> 
		Joint venture financing is similar to a partnership in that it must be created by agreement between the parties to share in the losses and profits of the venture.  Even though our clients may not start out looking for partners, they recognize the value of sharing equity over "straight" debt financing.  As a result, through joint venture financing, our Clients can reduce the amount of their personal capital at risk but still focus on the goal to get their project funded.  In some cases, joint venture financing may be the only way to get the project funded.
