                <h1><strong>Strategy  as a Management Philosophy</strong></h1>
		
	  <p><strong><em>Position, plan and evaluate but fail to understand  strategy, and you weaken the organization and the structure of the enterprise.</em></strong></p>
	  <p>Strategy is a logical system that defines functional levels  to enhance economic contributions by providing long-range objectives and  priorities for allocating resources. Successful organizations require coherent  and explicit blueprints that meet the demands of a changing competitive  environment. &nbsp;Strategy is a defined and  differentiated method for meeting external threats and opportunities that  leverages internal strengths to sustain long-term growth and shareholder value.</p>
	  <h1><strong>Master the Competition</strong> </h1>
	  <p>Define your organizations growth path through a series of  integrated decision points to position your business. Whether you are preparing  for growth, looking to acquire outside capital, designing new metrics or  striving to be customer-driven, a comprehensive business strategy will drive  your profits and maintain your organizations leadership.</p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Competitive       forces can reshape your business unless you manage and understand your       competitive position.</li>
