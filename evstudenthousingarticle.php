      width=100></SPAN><FONT size=2>The last year for me, personally and 
      professionally, has been a tumultuous yet overwhelming year of growth. I 
      lost two of the most important people in my life, my two grandmothers. At 
      the same time in business while most of my competitors were closing their 
      doors due to the harsh economic times that we are experiencing, I expanded 
      my business. What is the secret to thriving while others are languishing? 
      It is the ability to adapt to the circumstances we find ourselves in 
      business or our personal lives.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2><SPAN 
      style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><B>Yesterday</B></SPAN><BR>In recent 
      years, developers of student housing facilities had many options to choose 
      from to finance the costs of their projects. Local banks, pension funds, 
      Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac were just a few of the options that were 
      available to call upon. Equity requirements were much lower, debt service 
      coverage ratios were higher, and banks were actually lending money. 
      Developers could afford to build very high end facilities and command 
      higher rents.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2><SPAN 
      style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><B>Today</B></SPAN><BR>Finding 
      financing in today’s market is a real challenge for both developers of new 
      projects as well as the acquisition or refinance of others. Financing has 
      gotten so difficult that many developers are sitting on the sidelines. 
      Even some of the biggest developers are being scrutinized by underwriting 
      guidelines that did not exist in prior years due to banks’ wariness of 
      booking any bad loans. The biggest difference in the financing now is that 
      developers have to put more equity into each transaction because loan 
      proceeds are lower. A typical Loan to Cost for a construction loan is 65 – 
      70 percent.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>Even though Student Housing has not suffered as much as 
      the other multifamily sectors in this current economic environment, there 
      are certain markets that have softened and enrollments are down across the 
      country. Parents and students are looking for more affordable options for 
      their housing needs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><B>What does a 
      developer do in times like these? </B></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>Adapt to their circumstances.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>Watching the changes in the economy over the last two 
      years, I made a decision to partner our company with an Investment Bank 
      that finances multifamily and healthcare related properties through 
      FHA/HUD financing. At a time when conventional banks are not lending, and 
      only the strongest developer will make it through the scrutiny of Fannie 
      and Freddie programs, HUD offers another alternative that most student 
      housing developers do not consider.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>If a developer is willing to “adapt” his project to meet 
      the guidelines of HUD financing, this can be a very viable option to 
      consider. Many projects that are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the 
      right time, could be restructured and under construction long before the 
      economy changes. Changes to the structure of the leases and sometimes 
      configuration of the rooms will be necessary to adapt to this program. 
      This will at times decrease the profitability of the project but with 
      creative origination and structuring of the loan the prepayment penalties 
      can be reduced to accommodate a refinance within a shorter period of 
      time.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>The advantages to using this type of financing are much 
      higher LTC’s up to 90% and lower dscr at 1.1. This along with a 40 year 
      fixed construction to permanent loan and low interest rates, may be enough 
      to compensate for the lower rents that may need to be charged resulting in 
      a lower profit margin. The price of equity can be very costly and in some 
      cases, we can use excess land value or seller held seconds to totally 
      eradicate the need of any equity.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT size=2>Another creative way of adapting to this environment is to 
      create a joint venture either with a current landowner or company with 
      parallel goals. Through the strength of a partnership, liquidity and 
      equity issues can be resolved as well as management and experience 
      requirements by lenders.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2>We are in a time of change. In order to not only survive 
      but thrive as a developer in this tumultuous time is to be open and 
      creative to new ways of financing. Our company is available to advise, 
      structure and finance your student housing projects during this time.<SPAN 
      style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><B> </B></SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=2><SPAN 
      style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline"><B>Tomorrow</B></SPAN><BR>Overall, 
      lenders, investors and developers are confident that the Student Housing 
      market will continue to thrive as the market rebounds. We are hopeful that 
      conventional banks and life companies will re-enter the market. The 
      numbers of students predicted to be enrolling in universities going 
      forward is growing, thus the need for new developments increase as well. 
      As a company, we will adapt to the changes coming our way and help our 
      clients to navigate the ever changing times we encounter.</FONT></P>
