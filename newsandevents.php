		<h3>Equiventure introduces a unique 100% Financing Joint Venture program from a Direct Private Lender</h3>
		
		<p>Equiventure Capital has introduced an aggressive 100% financing Joint Venture program from one of their Direct Private Lenders.  This program has been receiving great attention since it does not involve any up-front costs; at closing the developer/investors are reimbursed for all approved costs; loan rate at LIBOR + 100-200 bs;  deferred loan repayment; etc.  In exchange the Joint Venture investor takes an equity position on the project.  The equity position can be purchased back by the original developer over a 10 year time frame or sooner.  The project must create new jobs and stimulate the local economy as a basis for the Joint Venture commitment.  Call us for more information so that we can evaluate the feasibility of your project fitting into this type loan program.</p>
